JavaScript Finite State Machine Builder
======================================= 

Version 0.2, 2007-12-30

This script embeds in JavaScript a domain-specific language 
-- a fluent interface, really -- for describing and building
simple finite state machines.

See the source code of spec/fsm.html and the files in examples
