JavaScript Finite State Machine Builder
======================================= 

Version 0.1.1, 2007-12-23

This script embeds in JavaScript a domain-specific language 
for describing and building simple finite state machines.

See the source code of spec/fsm.html for how it is supposed
to work.

The script is meant to be usable independently of any other
libraries, however, I intend to integrate generated FSMs
with DOM events and Prototype custom events.


== Changes

=== 0.1.1 (2007-12-23)
Add FSM.build() as suggested by Nicol√°s Sanguinetti.

=== 0.1 (2007-12-22)
First release.
