JavaScript Finite State Machine Builder
======================================= 

Version 0.1, 2007-12-22

This script embeds in JavaScript a domain-specific language 
for describing and building simple finite state machines.

See the source code of spec/fsm.html for how it is supposed
to work.

The script is meant to be usable independently of any other
libraries, however, I intend to integrate generated FSMs
with DOM events and Prototype custom events.

The manner in which an FSM is attached to classes/objects
is still rather convoluted. The general idea is that it
(a) should be possible to insert the FSM as the first link in
the prototype chain and
(b) should be possible to directly attach it to an existing
object.
